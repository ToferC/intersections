            <p>This application is an API for Government of Canada pay/salary scales for classifications and levels. The intent is to have a central, easy to access and use resource for accurate pay information. This will reduce duplication and potential errors across organizations and serve as an example of how APIs can support day-to-day business in government.</p>
