            <h1>Welcome to the Intersectional Data Survey and Analysis MVP</h1>
            <p>This is a learning project and experiment in collecting, connecting, and gaining insight from the lived experience of participants while protecting their privacy.</p>

                <h2>How can I participate?</h2>
                <p>In its pilot stage, Intersections works though invitations to specific communities and organizations. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:usersupport@intersectional-data.ca">usersupport@intersectional-data.ca</a> if you're interested in creating a community and testing the application.</p>
                <p>If you like, you can <a class="btn btn-dark" href="/full_community_graph/demo_community">Explore the demonstration data</a></p>

            <h2>Why does this project matter?</h2>
            <p>The current demographic surveys in use in the Government of Canada artificially divide people into (often binary) categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visible Minority (or not)</li>
                <li>Person with a disability (or not)</li>
                <li>Male, female or other</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This practice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Doesn’t represent the complexity of experience that each person brings to the table</li>
                <li>Does not explain how different people’s experiences of this part of their lives may differ greatly</li>
                <li>Does not track or infer the impact of what is assumed to be the “norm” - white, cis, abled, male</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This project is an attempt to build a data model and lens through which to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Better model lived experience as it relates to and impacts our work</li>
                <li>Build empathy and compassion for ourselves and others</li>
                <li>Make privilege and inclusiveness visible in our organizations so we can work to balance the scales</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>

            <h2>How will this project make things better?</h2>
            <p>This MVP is designed to give participants the control to define their lived experiences as they perceive them, one by one.</p>
            <p>By combining, or layering experiences, we can provide a more holistic understanding of a person’s lived experience in their own words.</p>
            <p>By combining lived experiences into a graph that links common concepts like “manager”, “woman”, “black”, “mother”, “father” or “millennial”, we can see how experiences interact with each other and develop a better understanding of how our workplaces impact our people.</p>
            <p>By calling out and making explicit the “normal”, we can identify systemic privilege and bias in our organizations.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2>What is this work based on?</h2>
            <p>The structure of the survey is based on the <a href="https://www.aecf.org/m/blogdoc/PersonRoleSystemFramework-2013.pdf">Person-Role-System</a>, a framework for understanding dynamic relationships between people in the roles and systems in which they function.</p>
            <p>You can learn about this framework and how it can contribute to culture change needed for equitable organizations below.</p>

            <h2>Is it finished?</h2>
            <p>No.</p>
            <p>This work is an MVP (minimal viable product) to test the survey, data and design methodology.</p>
            <p>There is a great deal of testing and questions to ask before I would put this in front of our employees.</p>
            <p>But it is a start and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwQNxUi1UTKMyLcltWJwC_vI1zGSkv-2JpBPwkufdGsFMHxg/viewform?usp=sf_link">I’d love your feedback.</a></p>
            <p>The code and issues can be created on <a href="https://github.com/toferc/intersections">Github</a>.</p>

            <h2>The survey asks personal questions. How will you protect my information?</h2>
            <p>Intersections has been designed to ensure your privacy.</p>
            <p>No identifying information is stored as part of the survey. When you finish the survey, you will be provided with a code so you can access your profile.</p>
            <p>You are the only person who will receive this code and without the code, no-one can view your profile.</p>
