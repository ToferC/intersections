## About

who = Who are you?
chris-description-1 = My name is Chris Allison. I'm an executive in the federal government of Canada and a developer / data person. I believe data is one of our best tools to identify and eliminate bias in our organizations. I'm working on this project as a way to test the hypothesis and work towards a more equitable and inclusive future.
chris-description-2 = I am white, male, heterosexual and cisgendered. My partner is black and my children are mixed. I'm working on this for them and to help break down systemic racist structures in our organizations.
forgive-me = I'm going to get things wrong. I hope you'll forgive my errors and help me get back on the path when I mis-step.
why-matter = Why does this project matter?
reasons-intro = The current demographic surveys in use in the Government of Canada artificially divide people into (often binary) categories:
reason-1 = Visible Minority (or not)
reason-2 = Person with a disability (or not)
reason-3 = Male, female or other
this-practice = This practice:
practice-1 = Doesn’t represent the complexity of experience that each person brings to the table
practice-2 = Does not explain how different people’s experiences of this part of their lives may differ greatly
practice-3 = Does not track or infer the impact of what is assumed to be the “norm” - white, cis, abled, male
attempt-to = This project is an attempt to build a data model and lens through which to:
attempt-1 = Better model lived experience as it relates to and impacts our work
attempt-2 = Build empathy and compassion for ourselves and others
attempt-3 = Make privilege and inclusiveness visible in our organizations so we can work to balance the scales
how-better = How will this project make things better?
better-1 = This MVP is designed to give participants the control to define their lived experiences as they perceive them, one by one.
better-2 = By combining, or layering experiences, we can provide a more holistic understanding of a person’s lived experience in their own words.
better-3 = By combining lived experiences into a graph that links common concepts like “manager”, “woman”, “black”, “mother”, “father” or “millennial”, we can see how experiences interact with each other and develop a better understanding of how our workplaces impact our people.
better-4 = By calling out and making explicit the “normal”, we can identify systemic privilege and bias in our organizations.
based-on = What is this work based on?
based-structure = The structure of the survey is based on the

how-protect-info = The survey asks personal questions. How will you protect my information?
